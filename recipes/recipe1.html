    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>Fried green tomatoes are a very simple appetizer with a self explanitory name.  Unripe red tomatoes seasoned, breaded, and fried to perfection.</p>
    <p>Fried green tomatoes were honestly not my favorite thing when I first tried them.  I got to eat them for the first time when I visited Georgia to see my dad.  But they grew on me and now whenever I visit family over there I secretly hope that they are planning to make them.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large green tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Slice tomatoes 1/2 inch think. Discard the ends.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and milk together in a medium-sized bowl. Scoop flour onto a plate. Mix cornmeal, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper on another plate. Dip tomatoes into flour to coat. Then dip tomatoes into milk and egg mixture; dredge in breadcrumbs to completely coat.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tomatoes in hot oil in batches of 4 or 5, to prevent them from touching; fry until crisp and golden brown on one side, then flip and fry on other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer fried tomatoes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
