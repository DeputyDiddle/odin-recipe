    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love cookie dough. Its pretty good, especially in ice cream.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the powers the be decided cookie dough was dangerous to consume raw, so here is a recipe that should be safe if you care about that.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use: Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
    </ol>
