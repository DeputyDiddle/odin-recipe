    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Not much to say on this one, in fact its just like the fried green tomatoes. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly inside it.</p> 
    <p>I ate these so much as a kid that I got sick of them, then grew back into them later in life.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread of your choice</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter of your choice</li>
        <li>Jelly of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out your two slices of bread</li>
        <li>Get some of that peanut butter on your knife and spread it on one slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Scrape residual peanut butter off the knife back into the peanut butter container, then what little is left on the knife can be wiped onto the empty slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Get some of that jelly on your knife and spread it on the other slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Slap those two slices together</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
